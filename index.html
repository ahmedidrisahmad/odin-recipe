    <h2>Description</h2>
       <p> Shekla tibs is one of the most  popular dishes among Ethiopians.</p>
        <p>It comes in a variety of forms, varying in type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used, <br>
             and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. A particularly <br>
             recommended variation is shekla tibs, in which the strips of meat arrive at your table <br>
             roasting atop a clay pot stoked with hot coals dramatic and delicious.</p>
        
        <p>Typically, the meat of the tibs that arrives at your table has just been cleaved from <br>
                 carcasses hanging outside beside the restaurant’s entrance. Don’t be put off; meat <br>
                  rarely comes fresher or tastier.</p>
                  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                    <li>2 pounds venison, lamb or beef, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>tablespoons berbere</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground fenugreek</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground clove</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 to 4 garlic cloves, sliced thinly</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole peeled tomatoes, broken into bits</li>
                    <li>1 to 5 green chiles, such as jalapenos or serranos</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ol>
                    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS </h4>
                    <li>Get the saute pan or wok very hot.</li>
                    <li>Stir-fry the onions without the butter for a few minutes, until they char
                      just a little on the outside.</li>
                      <li>Add the spiced butter and the venison.</li>
                      <li>Stir-fry hot and fast until the outside of the meat is brown but the inside of the meat is still very rare.</li>
                      <li>You need to do this on as hot a burner as you have. Do it in two batches unless you have a very large wok or pan.</li>
                      <li>The moment the meat has browned, add it all back into the pan along with the spices, garlic and chiles. </li>
                      <li>Stir-fry another 30 seconds or so, then add the tomatoes and the wine.
                        Toss to combine and let this cook for a minute or two. Serve at once with bread or injera.</li>
